    {
      "id": 1,
      "question": "What is RDF reification?",
      "expected_answer": "RDF reification is a mechanism that represents statements about RDF statements using rdf:Statement, rdf:subject, rdf:predicate, and rdf:object. It enables attaching provenance metadata but is inefficient and leads to triple bloat.",

      "question": "What does the term 'provenance' mean in RDF systems?",
      "expected_answer": "Provenance refers to the origin or source of data, including how it was produced, extracted, or derived. It is crucial for trust, reliability assessment, decision support, and understanding data quality.",

      "question": "What are the ten dimensions of explanation defined in GLUCOSE?",
      "expected_answer": "The ten dimensions describe causal relationships before and after an event X—covering direct causes, motivations, enabling states of location/possession, resulting events, emotional effects, changes in location or possession, and other property changes.",

    {
      "id": 6,
      "question": "How does RDF* represent provenance?",
      "expected_answer": "RDF* enables embedded triples using the syntax <<s p o>> allowing metadata such as provenance to be directly attached without full reification.",

      "question": "How does GLUCOSE convert semi-structured explanations into natural language?",

      "id": 8,
      "question": "How do named graphs capture provenance in RDF?",
      "expected_answer": "Named graphs represent RDF data as sets of triples grouped under graph IRIs, allowing one graph to hold assertions and another to encode provenance metadata linked via provenance vocabularies.",

      "question": "How does cognitive psychology influence GLUCOSE’s design?",
      "expected_answer": "GLUCOSE uses cognitive theories showing that humans explain events using causal chains, motivations, emotional states, and changes in attributes, inspiring the ten explanatory dimensions.",

      "question": "What is the difference between RDF reification and N-Quads?",
      "expected_answer": "Reification uses rdf:Statement with subject/predicate/object properties, causing triple bloat, while N-Quads add a fourth element (the graph name) enabling provenance without reifying every triple.",
